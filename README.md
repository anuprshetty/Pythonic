## Object-Oriented Programming

- A programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects.
- Class (Blueprint) or Object = State + Behavior

### Features of OOP

- Class
- Object
- Encapsulation
- Data Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic Binding
- Message Passing

### Advantages of OOP

- Modularity - Independent modules (Classes or Blueprints or objects)
- Extensibility - Objects can be extended to include new attributes and behavior.
- Reusability - Faster development and less cost of developement
- Maintainablity - Since the design is modular, we can make changes to the modules without making large-scale changes.
- Higher quality software - More time and resources can be used to test the software.
- Overall it improves software-development productivity.

### Classes

- Blueprint for creating objects.
- YOU design the class = state + behavior of the object.
- Class ~ Abstract, Instance ~ Concrete

### Identify classes in a problem statement

- Problem statement
- Identify objects
- Identify state + behavior for each objects.
- Create blueprints or classes

### Instances

- Objects created from the class.
- Instance Attributes vs Class Attributes

### Constructor - __init__()

- Special method used to define the initial state of the object when it's created.
- It is called automatically when an instance is created.
