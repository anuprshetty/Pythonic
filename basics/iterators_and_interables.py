# Iterable:
# - Something that can be looped over. Ex: List
# - If something is iterable, then it needs to have a special method called __iter__().
# - So a for loop will call the __iter__() method on an object and return an iterator that it can loop over.

# Iterator:
# - Iterator is an object with a state so that it remembers where it is during iteration.
# - And iterator also know how to get the next value. They get their next value with a __next__() method.
# NOTE:
# - The iterator can only go forward.
# - So there is no going backwards, resetting it or making a copy of it.
# - You can only go forward by calling next().
# - If you need to start from scratch, then you can simply create a new iterator object from scratch and just start that over.

# Difference between Iterator vs Generator:

# Iterator:
# 1. Class is used to implement an iterator
# 2. Local Variables arenâ€™t used here.
# 3. Iterators are used mostly to iterate or convert other objects to an iterator using iter() function.
# 4. Iterator uses iter() and next() functions
# 5. Every iterator is not a generator

# Generator:
# 1. Function is used to implement a generator.
# 2. All the local variables before the yield function are stored.
# 3. Generators are mostly used in loops to generate an iterator by returning all the values in the loop without affecting the iteration of the loop
# 4. Generator uses yield keyword
# 5. Every generator is an iterator
