# Generator functions:
# - A function or method which uses the yield statement is called a generator function.
# - Such a function, when called, always returns an iterator object which can be used to execute the body of the function: calling the iteratorâ€™s iterator.__next__() method will cause the function to execute until it provides a value using the yield statement.
# - When the function executes a return statement or falls off the end, a StopIteration exception is raised and the iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be returned.

# yield keyword:
# - Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement.
# - Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed a generator.

# List holds entire results in the memory.
# But Generator object don't hold entire results in the memory. It yields one result at a time. i.e., Later when we ask for a result, it will compute and give it to us.
# Advantages of Generators:
# - Generators are better with performance. It's not holding all the values in memory. Also it speeds up the computation time to some extent compared to list.

# NOTE:
# Generators can't be rewound.
# But you have the following options:
# 1. Run the generator function again, restarting the generation.
# 2. Store the generator results in a data structure on memory or disk which you can iterate over again.
# - The downside of option 1 is that it computes the values again. If that's CPU-intensive you end up calculating twice.
# - On the other hand, the downside of 2 is the storage. The entire list of values will be stored on memory. If there are too many values, that can be unpractical.
# --> So you have the classic memory vs. processing tradeoff.
# --> So ways of rewinding the generator are either storing the values or calculating them again.
