# Python - Method Overriding:
# - Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.
# - It allows for a specific type of polymorphism (subtyping).
# - Overriding is an example of run time polymorphism.

# Java - Method Overriding:
# - Method overriding is one of the way by which java achieve Run Time Polymorphism.
# - The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it.
# - If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed.
# - In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.
